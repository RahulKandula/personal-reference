1. San getting outright offended when we said it is ok to rish on his comment about constant kissing in the youtube channel. I should have watched my words. Think of all the responses you give out, they should reflect your stance on stuff.

1. In the night out, when thrinesh said kids these days are just talking of netflix instead of like them and he finds it weird. Also, sumanth stating he finds ppl who crack baad jokes. I felt bad over both of these.
